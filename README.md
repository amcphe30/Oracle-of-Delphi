Creative project for PHIL 211 Greek Philosohpy I.

We were asked to create a creative project that connects ideas from Greek Philosohpy with another domain of our own interest. The invested effort required is roughly equal to an 1000 word essay and is more of a completion grade. I thought I would take the opportunity to explore React and web dev as my courses at UBC so far have not included that kind of content.
